Using the file hott-book.labels to provide all the labels,
the first attempt to fix the cross-refs issue was to change all the usages of \cref by \ref.
Then, comment all the labels definition, I used this in my editor:

regex: ((?:\\fakelabel\{(?:[a-zA-z0-9:-]|\?)+\}\s*)+)(.*)?
by:    $2\% -- (original) -> $1$2

Replace all matches in: /Users/jonaprieto/repositories/hott-cheatsheet,-*.sty

(not necessary now for somereason)
